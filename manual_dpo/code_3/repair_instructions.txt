MEMORY MODEL FIX:
(none)

BOUNDS / ACCESS FIX:
Insert "if (tail) { ... }" guard so we never dereference a NULL pointer when stitching the recursive Cantor segments together. Append the left and right lists after walking to the tail instead of blindly writing to head->next.

FUNCTION SIGNATURE FIX:
(none)

TYPE FIX:
(none)
