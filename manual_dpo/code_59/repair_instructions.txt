MEMORY MODEL FIX:
(none)

BOUNDS / ACCESS FIX:
Bound every shift loop by the logical array size and reject insert/delete requests that would underflow/overflow the fixed storage. After a deletion, clear the trailing slot so no stale values are read when iterating to n.

FUNCTION SIGNATURE FIX:
Represent the array as an IntArray struct that carries both the buffer and its active length so helpers no longer receive a raw pointer + value copy of n that can drift out of sync.

TYPE FIX:
(none)
