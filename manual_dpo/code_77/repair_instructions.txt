TYPE FIX:
Make insert() and treePathsSum() operate on pointers instead of passing struct-by-value:
- Define insert(struct Node *root, int data) to return the subtree root and recursively assign to root->left/right.
- Rework treePathsSumUtil() so it accepts struct Node * and accumulates the base-10 path sum during the traversal instead of trying to mutate local structs.
- Guard allocation errors with malloc checks and include <limits.h> for clarity.
