MEMORY MODEL FIX:
(none)

BOUNDS / ACCESS FIX:
(none)

FUNCTION SIGNATURE FIX:
(none)

TYPE FIX:
Give the anonymous struct a real typedef name and build a minimal AVL example that actually compiles:
- Declare `typedef struct Node { ... } Node;` with left/right pointers and initialize them in new_node().
- Implement insert/rotations/inorder traversal so the program exercises the tree instead of stopping at the unterminated typedef.
