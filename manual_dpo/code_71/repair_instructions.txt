MEMORY MODEL FIX:
(none)

BOUNDS / ACCESS FIX:
(none)

FUNCTION SIGNATURE FIX:
(none)

TYPE FIX:
Replace the bogus parent-pointer logic and the unreadable ternary expressions with a memoized largest-independent-set implementation:
- Extend struct Node with a memo field and make newNode() initialize it.
- Implement liss() that returns the cached value when available, computes the "exclude" and "include" cases explicitly, and stores the best result in memo.
- largestIndependentSet() simply calls liss().
