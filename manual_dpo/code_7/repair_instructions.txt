MEMORY MODEL FIX:
(none)

BOUNDS / ACCESS FIX:
(none)

FUNCTION SIGNATURE FIX:
(none)

TYPE FIX:
Replace the malformed source header lines that still contained literal line-number prefixes ("  2:" etc.) with normal preprocessor directives so clang sees valid tokens. While touching the routine, tighten atoi parsing by skipping leading spaces with isspace() and clamping overflow to INT_[MIN|MAX].
