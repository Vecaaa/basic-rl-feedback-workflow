MEMORY MODEL FIX:
(none)

BOUNDS / ACCESS FIX:
(none)

FUNCTION SIGNATURE FIX:
Provide real definitions for insert(), find_position_to_delete(), and delete_element() so main no longer calls implicit declarations. Each helper now takes explicit lengths, returns a freshly allocated buffer, and communicates the new logical size through an out-parameter.

TYPE FIX:
Use size_t for positions, return int* from the helpers, and ensure comparisons use the same signedness (compare pos against (size_t)-1 instead of magic -1 integers).
