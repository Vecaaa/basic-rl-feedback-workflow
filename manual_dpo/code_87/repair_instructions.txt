MEMORY MODEL FIX:
(none)

BOUNDS / ACCESS FIX:
(none)

FUNCTION SIGNATURE FIX:
(none)

TYPE FIX:
Read the floating-point input into a double via "%lf" so scanf/mocks write the correct width (KLEE previously wrote 8 bytes into a 4-byte float). Also move the summation into a helper that actually uses x in the formula so the computation is meaningful.
