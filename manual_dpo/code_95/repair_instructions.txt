MEMORY MODEL FIX:
(none)

BOUNDS / ACCESS FIX:
Track the position being filled explicitly and stop writing into arr[end - k + 1], which could exceed the buffer. The recursive helper now takes "pos" and "next" arguments so every assignment targets arr[pos] where 0 <= pos < k.

FUNCTION SIGNATURE FIX:
(none)

TYPE FIX:
Allocate the temporary combination buffer with calloc(k, sizeof(int)) so the size matches the runtime k.
