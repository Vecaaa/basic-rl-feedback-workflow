MEMORY MODEL FIX:
(none)

BOUNDS / ACCESS FIX:
(none)

FUNCTION SIGNATURE FIX:
(none)

TYPE FIX:
Replace the stray natural-language instructions with a real implementation of mod_mul() using the repeated-doubling (Russian peasant) technique so we never overflow 64-bit intermediates. Keep all arithmetic reduced modulo mod at each addition/multiplication.
