MEMORY MODEL FIX:
(none)

BOUNDS / ACCESS FIX:
Stop indexing the destination buffer as if it also contained the second sorted sequence. Pass a dedicated second[] input array into merge() and walk both inputs with explicit lengths so i and j never run beyond the backing storage.

FUNCTION SIGNATURE FIX:
Replace "void merge(int m, int n, int N[], int mPlusN[])" with "void merge(int m, int n, const int first[], const int second[], int out[])" so we no longer alias the destination with a placeholder buffer.

TYPE FIX:
(none)
